# Progress: Fizy Music Bot

## What Works
- **Core Bot & Userbot**: Basic startup and initialization successfully working.
- **Database Integration**: MongoDB connection and caching verified.
- **Start Command**: Welcome messages and user/chat registration working.
- **Localization**: Languages are correctly loading.
- **Startup Feedback**: Initial bot mentions and log messaging verified.
- **Help Menu**: Safe key access prevents crashes for missing locale keys.
- **YouTube Downloads**: Multiple format fallback system for reliable downloads.
- **Quiz**: Fixed snippet download with proper format and timeout handling.
- **Search (/bul)**: Fixed with play_markup method added.
- **Downloader (/indir)**: Fixed with proper import and format args.

## Current Fixes
- Fixed TikTok download links (`vt.tiktok.com`, `vm.tiktok.com`) by expanding URL regex.
- Rebuilt `/yarisma` (Quiz) command with full interactive setup via inline keyboards (Language, Genre, Rounds selection).
- Fixed Quiz audio extraction bug (0-byte Unknown Track files) by using python `yt_dlp` with `download_ranges` instead of unstable `ffmpeg` postprocessor arguments.
- `KeyError: 'help_close'` — callbacks.py now uses safe `.get()` fallback
- `Requested format is not available` — youtube.py now tries 3 format variants per cookie

## Previous Fixes
- `AttributeError: 'coroutine' object has no attribute 'add_reaction'` in `start.py` fixed.

## What's Left to Build / Verify
- **Other Locale Files**: ar, de, es, fr, hi, ja, my, pa, pt, ru, zh need new keys (help_playlist, quiz keys, etc.)
- **Playlist Play**: Verify `/playlist play` for queue integration in groups.
- **Admin Commands**: Confirm `/sustur`, `/ac`, and `/bitir` functionality.
- **Interaction Polish**: Ensure all bot messages have the premium look.
- **Group Registration**: Verify `_new_member` logic and leave logic for non-supergroups.

## Known Issues
- Other locale files missing many new keys (falls back to en.json gracefully via the safe .get())
- Quiz song pool video IDs need verification against current YouTube availability

## Project Decision Tracking
- **Feb 2025**: Initial development with KumsalTR core.
- **March 2026**: Migration to Kurigram for enhanced UI/UX (colored buttons, animated emojis).
- **March 2026**: Moving towards premium branding and interaction feedback.
- **March 27, 2026**: Major bug fix session — YouTube downloads, help callbacks, quiz, and extras.
